Battleships
===========

Week 4 Project: Create an interactive battleships game

Battleships is a two player game. Each player deploys 5 ships on a 10 x 10 grid. Each cell has a unique grid reference. Each player takes turns to call out a grid reference and the other players confirms whether it is a ‘hit’ or ‘miss’ if a ship is at that grid reference or not. The attacking players marks the ‘hit’ or ‘miss’ on their tracking grid. The defending player marks ‘hit’ or ‘miss’ on their primary grid. Players alternate turns. When every cell that comprises one ship has been ‘hit’, the defending player declares it sunk. When a player sinks all their opponent’s ships they win and the game ends.
